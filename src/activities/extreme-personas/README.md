## Extreme Personas

As a designer, the most important skill you can acquire is learning to empathize with the people you are designing for. It’s easy to design things for ourselves, but harder to imagine how other people will engage with the things we make.

With this activity, we’ll step outside the popular genre of “products designed by designers for designers”, and try to get past our own biases in the process. This should also help you start thinking about how to “hack” existing objects as part of your Critical Objects project.

#### Design Brief

When we think about the audience for our design work, it’s helpful to think about the various personas of people who might use what we’re making. For this exercise, we’ll be designing for a few “extreme personas” with specific and unusual requirements.

Your group will be randomly assigned a persona. Your job is to design a wallet for this person. Think about ways that the normal physical design of this object might not work for the intended user. The prototype you create doesn’t need to look like anything currently on the market. It can do all, some, or none of the same tasks that the object currently performs.

#### Some questions to discuss as a group:

- What specific needs does this person have that might be different from your own?

- Why do you think those needs aren't being met by existing offerings?

- As a designer, how would you use your skills to solve these problems if you found yourself in a similar situation?

Start sketching out some ideas. Your ideas can be ridiculous or impractical, but they should respond to a real need, and manifest in a physical prototype that you can show to the class. Make a cardboard prototype of the object you’ve designed. We’ll hold a mini-critique of these objects at the end of class.
