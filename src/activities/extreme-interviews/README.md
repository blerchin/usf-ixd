# Extreme Interviews

Recall the personas we used in our prototyping exercise. These were what we might call "provisional personas," because they were based entirely on speculation about who we might be designing for. Their habits, problems, and goals were entirely made up based on our (my) limited knowledge of what someone else's life looks like.

Today we're going to role-play a series of interviews and information-modeling  techniques that we would use if we wanted to validate the assumptions we made about our users. Since we don't have access to interview subjects with the particular backgrounds in our original design brief, you'll each be interviewed as if you were a potential user of your product. In our last class, your entire group was designing for a particular persona. This time, you'll be representing this persona for the rest of your group. During your interview you should answer questions as if you were this person.

We'll structure this exercise as follows:

### Brainstorm (10 minutes)
As a group, come up with a series of interview topics relevant to people who will use your product (still a wallet.) These should be general subject areas, not specific questions.

Write down your interview topics. (10 minutes)

### Interview (20 minutes)
Take turns interviewing each person. One group member should take notes.
Try to address each of the topics you wrote down, but feel free to ask clarifying questions or go off on tangents.
Each interview should last about five minutes.

### Isolate (15 minutes)
As a group, look over your notes and circle as many ideas as you can in the notes you took. Write each one of these down on its own post-it note. Write down **insights** on a blue note, **problems** on a pink note, and **goals** on a green note

Try to quote your interviewee directly, if possible.

### Synthesize (20 minutes)
As a class, we’ll merge all our insights together on the board. Each turn, someone in the group can add a note to the board, move an existing note, or write a label on the board.

Without defining exactly what the categories are, we’ll try to group similar ideas together. If a post-it duplicates an idea that’s already on the board, place it on top of the existing one.

We keep rotating until we are all out of notes to add.

### Identify (30 minutes)
Back in your groups, identify and write 3-4 personas that better reflect the different groups you are designing for. You may use any criteria you like to define the new personas – they don't have to match the particular people you interviewed.

Come up with names and brief descriptions for each of these personas.
Refer back to About Face Ch. 5 on guidance for how to write the personas.

### Present (20 minutes)
Share the profiles you wrote and discuss with the class.
