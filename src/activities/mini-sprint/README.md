## Mini Design Sprint

In preparation for our first project, we're kicking off a mini design sprint in class. Your task, working in groups, is to come up with as many ideas as possible for a new "reaction".

Here's how this works:

### Problem
Spend 10 minutes silently writing down as many _Problems_ as you can. For this exercise, this can be any issue you, or someone you know, regularly experience using social software. Choose a color of sticky note to represent Problems, and write down one Problem on each one.

- Example: Sometimes I want to respond to my friend's story and I don't have time right now.

### Insight
Spend 10 minutes writing down _Insights_. This can be anything you know about how people use this, or similar software. Pick a new color to represent Insights.
 - Example: People usually have time to respond to messages when they are on public transit.

### Solution
Mix up everyone's insights. Spend 20 minutes combining a _Problem_ and an _Insight_ from the pile to come up with a _Solution_. Place the problem and insight on the page, and write down your solution. If you want to re-use a problem or insight, just write it directly on the page. Come up with as many solutions as you can.
- Example: Users can mark a post as "respond later." Next time they are at a bus stop or train station, they get a notification linking them to the post they marked so they can respond while they are waiting.

### Voting
Everyone in the class gets 5 chips. They all count the same, even if they're different colors. Read through everyone's ideas, and place a chip on each of the five ideas you think is best. You can only place one chip per idea.
