## The Circle Game
#### (apologies to Joni Mitchell)

[Link to download the starter sketch](https://framer.cloud/kIKET)

You've just learned how to build [this game](http://usf-ixd.online/src/exercises/blue-circle/blue-circle.framer/index.html) in Framer. Your task now is to make the game more interesting, and to add scoring. Here are some ideas:
- Consider adding multiple circles, or other shapes
- Use different types of interactions (dragging, swiping, or device movements like tilting)
- Add multiple levels

Your sketch should keep track of how many times the blue bubble has been clicked (or any other actions you have determined count toward or against the score), and show this in the interface somehow.

Your ambition here will probably depend on your pair's coding ability. Pick something that will be challenging, but that you have some idea how to achieve. Note that I will be grading on originality and completeness rather than programmatic complexity.

You should work as a pair in class, but then complete the assignment on your own at home. **You will be docked points if you and your partner turn in the exact same project.**


Please turn in this assignment by sending me a link in Canvas to the project on Framer Cloud. We will go over how to do this in class.
