### Eloquent CoffeeScript
### Intro â€” Ch 2

Today we are going to step out of Framer's graphical environment and hunker down on some programming essentials. Concepts like conditionals and loops are going to be essential for us moving forward, so its worth spending some time understanding what's going on under the hood.

_Eloquent JavaScript_ by Marijn Haverbeke is a classic book that has started the careers of many enthusiastic programmers. One of its many great features is that it can be read in the browser, where most code samples can be run and edited inline with the text.

I've updated (read: copied) this text and transcribed all examples to CoffeeScript, so the code you write should be directly transferrable to your work in Framer.

In class today, please get as far as you can in this book, with the goal of completing the exercises at the end of Chapter 2. It's OK if you don't get this far in class. It's more important to read through every example carefully and understand the underlying concepts. Let me know if you're getting stuck.

You may work solo, or in pairs.

When working on the examples, you may use the code editor in the browser, or work in Framer. Your homework for Wednesday Feb 7 will be to submit the solutions to these exercises as a Framer sketch.

You can find _Eloquent CoffeeScript_ at the URL <eloquent.coffee>.
