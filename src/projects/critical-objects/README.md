## Project 2: Critical Objects

### Design Brief

Take an object that you use frequently and make it interactive. Your modification should make some issue related to its use visible, tangible, or audible. Think of Dunne and Raby’s notion of critical design. Most likely your project will make the object harder – not easier – to use. In any case, think about the ways that interactive functions can change the way you interact with the objects that surround you.

Your project should use electronics, including Arduino, and at least one input and one output device. This should be an original idea – not something that you could find in a store - and ideally not something another designer has already come up with.

Be ready to justify your intervention, and the social context for its use.

Successful projects might sound like these ones:

- “I made a cell phone case that pokes me if I hold my phone for too long, because I think people are too addicted to their phones.”
- “This water filter only works 80% of the time, raising awareness of unsanitary conditions in rust belt cities with lead poisoning in their water.”
- “This clothing hanger lights up if I haven’t worn the garment on it in three weeks, reminding its owner about mass consumption and fast fashion.”

### Timeline
- **Wednesday March 21** Come to class with notes on your project idea. I will check in with each of you individually. This is your chance to get feedback on your idea, and suggestions for how to implement a prototype.
- **Wednesday ~~April 4~~ April 11** Projects due. In-class critique.


### Rubric

| Name | Criteria | Pts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Requirements | The prototype meets or exceeds the stated expectations for the project. Student has used the software or hardware tools specified to produce an interactive prototype according to the constraints of the assignment | 40 points |
| Technical Execution | The project shows mastery of applicable skills relating to the tools and concepts covered in the course so far. | 20 points |
| Design Sophistication | Interactive and graphic elements of the project show consistency, style, and attention to detail. The project effectively communicates the prototyped interactions, while considering the style conventions appropriate to its intended audience. | 20 points |
| Idea | The project demonstrates a defined and original concept for a proposed interaction, which is relevant to the original brief. In particular, the prototype should articulate and attempt to solve a specific design problem that the student has identified. | 20 points |
| | **Total Points** | 100 |
