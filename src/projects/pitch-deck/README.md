## Project 3: Pitch Deck

### Design Brief

For this assignment, you will 'pitch' one of your previous creations to the class. Depending on the project, this might be a serious pitch about how your product will improve the lives of consumers. Or it might be a tongue-in-cheek parody. In either case, the important thing is that you tell the story of the project in a way anyone (a non-technical, non-design audience) can understand.

Your pitch can take the form of a slide deck. The product you are pitching should be either your Reactions project or your Critical Object.

You should aim to grab your audience's attention with stunning visuals, but you also need to convince them that this product could fit into their life.

### Requirements:
- Make a 7 minute presentation with slides
- Include high quality **photo or video documentation** (we'll have an opportunity to work on this in class)
- Make your point with **User Research** (choose one of the following)
  - Insights and personas drawn from three or more user interviews
  - At least one User Experience Map or similar diagram
- Explain how your research justifies the product you are pitching (e.g.: All of my interviewees reported frustration with overuse of digital technology, so I built a hat that pokes you when you've been on the computer too long.)

In your pitch, you should clearly communicate to your audience the problems that your product addresses, and how it will solve them.

Your deck should be in Google Slides, and should take about 7 minutes to present. This does not have to be an auto-advance (pecha kucha) presentation, but the time limit *will* be enforced.

### Criteria for User Research

#### User Interviews
Start by interviewing people in your community (these can be friends, family, classmates or people in your professional network.) Take notes, record audio and take photos if possible.

Follow the process we practiced in class to narrow down your findings to three or four personas. Design a one-page summary for each persona. Here are some good<super>*</super> examples of what a persona looks like: <http://www.insightfulempathy.com/research-methods/personas/>

If possible, incorporate direct quotes from your interviews into the persona document. Turn in interview notes/transcripts with your persona so I can see your process.

<small><super>*</super> The graphic design leaves a lot to be desired, but the information and layout is very good.</small>

#### Experience Map
This option involves a bit more imagination and hypothesis, since you likely won't have time to do interviews _and_ a map. We'll go over how to make an experience map in class. You can model yours after any of the styles shown in _Experience Mapping_. Explain the ideal experience of using your product and how it addresses any shortcomings of existing offerings. Print your map out as an 11x17 or larger poster.

#### Note:
Whichever format you choose, please print it and bring to class on April 30th.
