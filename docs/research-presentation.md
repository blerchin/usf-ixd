## Research Presentation

Throughout the course, we will structure our discussions around a series of weekly topics in Interaction Design theory, listed below. As researcher for the week, you will compile relevant visual references and a short list of discussion questions for the class.

This is primarily _Visual Research_, and as such I expect your slides will consist mostly of images and/or videos. You may include multiple pictures of the same software/hardware system to illustrate its different aspects, but your talk must include at least five unique works.
**Cite all media according to MLA guidelines.**

If possible, find positive and negative examples. _e.g._ If your topic was Feedback, you could show an app that uses microinteractions to successfully communicate that the user's intent was registered, and one that fails to do so. 

### Format
Your presentation should be created in Google Slides, and will be delivered in Pecha Kucha/Ignite Talk format. 20 slides, 15 seconds per slide. Please do rehearse your talk so you know how much time you will have.

The last slide (#20) should consist of three questions to prompt a class discussion.

I don't expect you to become an expert on the topic, nor to come up with any original scholarship for this project. Depending on your topic, simple googling may be enough to come up with examples. The best examples will be from software/hardware that you use and are familiar with. Historical or experimental works are great, too. If you get stuck and can't find anything, I encourage you to email me or meet with me during office hours. I can provide you with starting points for your research.

__*Start early*, especially if your presentation date coincides with another assignment.__

## Topics


[Week 1: Affordances: BL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1803dJOAIuCqsMPxDK3nKHXr-a0jf04M2tOuUZrMknmE/edit#slide=id.g2f279ea85c_0_0)
> "Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.” (Norman 19)

Week 2: Learnability: LS
> "Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?" (Norman 3)

Week 3: Feedback: KP
> "There is full and continuous information agout the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state." (Norman 72)

Week 4: Consistency: MR
> "According to the principle of consistency, systems are more usable and learnable when similar parts are expressed ins imilar ways. Consistency enables people to efficiently transfer knowledge to new contexts, learn new things quickly, and focus attention on the relevant aspects of a task." (Lidwell et al., _Universal Principles of Design_)

Week 5: Efficiency: JO
> "\[Good tools\] allw us to perform tasks in the most immediate and direct manner without unnecessary intermediate steps or delayed results." (Murray 302)

Week 6: Criticality: DY
> "Critical design is related to haute couture, concept cars, design propaganda, and visions of the future, but its purpose is not to present the dreams of industry, attract new business, anticipate new trends or test the market. Its purpose is to stimulate discussion and debate amongst designers, industry and the public about the aesthetic quality of our electronically mediated existence." (Dunne & Raby 58)

Week 7: Tangibility: DM
> "A user may choose to work with a product despite it being difficult to use, because it is challenging, seductive, playful, surprising, memorable or rewarding, resulting in enjoyment of the experience. No musician learnt to play the violin because it was easy." (Overbeeke et al, _Beauty in usability: Forget about ease of use!_, 2002)

Week 8: Spring Break

Week 9: Emotionality: CC, AC
> "Most products do not cause fear, running, or fleeing, but badly designed devices can induce frustration and anger, a feeling of helplessness and despair, and possibly even hate. Well-designed devices can induce pride and enjoyment, a feeling of being in control and pleasure—possibly even love and attachment." (Norman 55)

Week 10: Sensing: JY
> "In interacting successfully with our physical world, our bodily movements and the perception of movement in our environment are essential. Yet movement plays a more than merely functional role. Both our bodily movements and the perception of physical movement may contribute to the aesthetic of our experiences with interactive products. Performing bodily movements and building bodily skill can be both challenging and highly rewarding, whilst we are also perceptually sensitive to the beauty and expressiveness of movement in our physical environment. (Djajadiningrat et al, _Easy doesn't do it: skill and expression in tangible aesthetics_)

Week 11: Habit: HC
> "Cognitive psychologists define _habits_ as 'automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues': things we do with little or no conscious thought. The products and services we use habitually alter our everyday behavior, just as their designers intended. (Eyal, _Hooked_ 1)

Week 12: Temporality: IF
> "In information visualization time can instead be one of the dimensions to be visualized, meaning that time here is seen as data rather than time in itself; it is being turned into graphics rather than remaining as time (unlike in real-time simulations of events). (Lundgren, _Teaching and Learning Aesthetics of Interaction_ 41)

Week 13: Conversation: CD
> "The relationship between the interactor and any digital artifact is reciprocal, active, and open to frustrating miscommunication. _The designer must therefore scrpt both sides so that the actions of humans and machines are meaningful to one another._ (Murray 55)

Week 14: Embodiment: LV
> "Embodied Interaction is interaction with computer systems that occupy our world, a world of physical and social reality, and that exploit this fact in how they interact with us." (Dourish, _Where the Action is_ 3)

Week 15: Immersiveness: JV
> "Being able to move around in the world and interact with pieces of the world enables learning in ways that reading books and listening to words do not." (Klemer & Takayama, _How Bodies Matter: Five Themes for Interaction Design_)

Week 16: Tactics: NK
> "Tactical media do not just report events, as they are never impartial they always participate and it is this that more than anything separates them from mainstream media." (Garcia & Lovink, _The ABC of Tactical Media)
