## Research Presentation

Throughout the course, we will structure our discussions around a series of weekly topics in Interaction Design theory, listed below. As researcher for the week, you will compile relevant visual references and a short list of discussion questions for the class.

This is primarily _Visual Research_, and as such I expect your slides will consist mostly of images and/or videos. You may include multiple pictures of the same software/hardware system to illustrate its different aspects, but your talk must include at least five unique works.
**Cite all media according to MLA guidelines.**

If possible, find positive and negative examples. _e.g._ If your topic was Feedback, you could show an app that uses microinteractions to successfully communicate that the user's intent was registered, and one that fails to do so. 

### Format
Your presentation should be created in Google Slides, and will be delivered in Pecha Kucha/Ignite Talk format. 20 slides, 20 seconds per slide. Please do rehearse your talk so you know how much time you will have.

The last slide (#20) should consist of three questions to prompt a class discussion.

I don't expect you to become an expert on the topic, nor to come up with any original scholarship for this project. Depending on your topic, simple googling may be enough to come up with examples. The best examples will be from software/hardware that you use and are familiar with. Historical or experimental works are great, too. If you get stuck and can't find anything, I encourage you to email me or meet with me during office hours. I can provide you with starting points for your research.

__*Start early*, especially if your presentation date coincides with another assignment.__
