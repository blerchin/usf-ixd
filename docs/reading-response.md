## Reading Responses

I have assigned relevant readings throughout the semester in the history and practice of Interaction Design. The readings are available in PDF format on the course website, or as web-based texts. All are available as links on the [syllabus](/#schedule). Readings will be due on Mondays, approximately every other week. Please come to class having read and reflected on the assigned texts. I highly encourage you to print and mark up the text as you read, but I will leave it up to you to decide what study strategy works best for you personally.

Please write a short reflection (150-300 words) on each reading assignment. Show me that you have read and thought about the texts, and their application to the ideas and techniques we have been working on in class. Try to get past what you 'liked' or didn't like. Here are a few questions to get you started:

- How does this reading connect to the course theme for the week?
- Compare and contrast the two texts. What would the authors agree upon? How do they differ?
- What surprised you?
- What connections can you make to ideas you have encountered in your other classes?
- What was challenging, or difficult to understand?

Please submit your responses in Canvas.
