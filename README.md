## Course Info

#### Course type: upper division studio elective
#### Prerequisites: Digital Literacy
#### Credits: 4

#### Course Rationale
The course Interaction Design will serve as an upper division studio elective in the newly expanded interdisciplinary Design curriculum.  This curriculum will offer students a comprehensive design education by providing them fluency with what we call design‚Äôs Seven Pillars of Learning: Design Process, Design Research, Digital Literacy, Design Production, Design History, Design Theory/Critical Thinking, and Design Leadership.  Interaction Design will advance student‚Äôs understanding of Design Process, Design Production, and Digital Literacy as they pertain to the practice of creating advanced interactive works and programming structures, and will provide students with advanced experience in Design Theory/Critical Thinking and Design Leadership.

#### Course Description
Building on the skills learned in Digital Literacy, this class advances students‚Äô technical and conceptual skills in interaction design. Coursework emphasizes immersive and engaging user experience, site optimization, data visualization, networked databases, and design solutions through critical thinking and technical application.  Technically students will learn computer programming skills that may include advanced ActionScript, Processing, or others.  Students may also have the opportunity to explore physical interaction design and physical computing using Arduino.  Conceptually this class will explore ideas about human-machine interaction from mouse clicks to cyborg theory; interface design as it relates to the Internet, animation, game design and interactive media; form and interactivity in programming structures, and algorithmic systems.  

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of the semester, students will be expected to:

1. Develop web-based interactive projects, focusing on input and output functions as they relate to form, function and concept, through presentation of conceptual plans, creation of project prototypes, and submission of original project work.

2. Demonstrate an understanding of advanced scripting languages and techniques through oral/visual presentations of conceptual project proposals, the completion of technical exercises and the submission of original project work.

3. Demonstrate introductory physical computing skills, with a focus on interaction, interface design and mechanization, through the completion of technical exercises, presentation of conceptual plans, creation of project prototypes, and the submission of original project work.

4. Create dynamic strategies for organizing and presenting digital information through oral/visual presentations of conceptual project proposals, the completion of technical exercises and the submission of original project work.

5. Explain the significance of the key developments in the history of digital media, with a focus on how the precursors to interactivity lead to current contemporary practices, through participation in group discussions and writing of final project text.

## Grading

### Letter Grade Definitions 
Assignments are invitations to experiment, invent, iterate, and refine. Creative, ambitious projects will receive high marks, while easily obtained or obvious solutions will receive lower marks. Grading will be determined based on conceptual approaches to each assignment, and its execution -- that is, the project's ability to successfully communicate to its intended audience. 

| Letter Grade | Requirements |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A** | Successful fulfillment of the project‚Äôs goals -- project conceptualization, planning, design, and execution performed at the highest level. Project completed with a well-conceived, original, and cohesive visual and artistic aesthetic, and superlative process documentation and written description. |
| **B** | Successful fulfillment of the project‚Äôs goals -- project conceptualization, planning, design, and execution performed at an above average level. Project completed with a well-conceived, cohesive visual and artistic aesthetic, and excellent process documentation and written description. |
| **C** |	Successful fulfillment of the project‚Äôs goals -- project conceptualization, planning, design, and execution performed at an average level. Project completed with adequate process documentation and written description, but without a cohesive artistic or visual aesthetic. |
| **D** |	Did not complete the project‚Äôs goals and/or process documentation was absent or inadequate. Project conceptualization, planning, design, and execution performed below average. |
| **F** |	Did not complete the project‚Äôs goals and/or process documentation was absent or inadequate. Does not meet the minimum requirements for the course. |

### Grade Weights by Project
In this course, you will complete three large assignments, each supported by multiple exercises to be assigned in class. These exercises are meant to bolster and support your learning and experimentation, and to integrate new skills. Scores earned on all exercises be rolled up into the final project grade for that project. Detailed descriptions will be available on this website once assigned.

| Weight | Project |
| :---   | :--- |
| **15%** | **Assignment 1: Reactions**. Reconceive an existing platform with a new way of engaging with, or responding to content. Present a clickable 2D prototype in Framer. |
| **20%** | **Assignment 2: TBA**. Present a physical prototype built in Arduino. |
| **30%**   | **Assignment 3: TBA**. Research, test, and document a solution to a problematic digital interaction you have identified. Your choice of media. |
| **15%** | **Readings & Reading Responses**. Read all assigned readings and write thoughtful responses. Engage in in-class discussions of each reading with your fellow classmates, and consider readings when developing your own work. |
| **5%**  | **Research Presentation**. Throughout the semester, we will collectively learn about various topics in Interaction Design theory. Give a five-minute presentation to the class on the date specified for the topic you have been assigned. This presentation will entail outside research, and a synthesis of researched material to the themes and readings of this course.
| **15%** | **Participation**. Come to class on time and prepared to discuss readings, projects, and ideas. Participation includes engagement in discussions, in-class workshops and activities, and critiques. Giving your full attention to your classmates in critiques is both expected and also a gift: nowhere else do we get the ability to have so many eyes and opinions focused on our work, with the intention to help our artistic practice develop. It is expected that you will be generous with your investment in each other‚Äôs work, and that you will show this generosity by giving your undivided attention to your classmates through the critique structure. |
