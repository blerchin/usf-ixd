[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/usf-ixd/usf-ixd.svg?token=LKAyuftmorXjAPyN1Qyx&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/usf-ixd/usf-ixd)

## Fall 2018
## University of San Francisco

### Course type: upper division studio elective
### Prerequisites: Digital Literacy
### Credits: 4

#### Course Rationale
The course Interaction Design will serve as an upper division studio elective in the newly expanded interdisciplinary Design curriculum.  This curriculum will offer students a comprehensive design education by providing them fluency with what we call design’s Seven Pillars of Learning: Design Process, Design Research, Digital Literacy, Design Production, Design History, Design Theory/Critical Thinking, and Design Leadership.  Interaction Design will advance student’s understanding of Design Process, Design Production, and Digital Literacy as they pertain to the practice of creating advanced interactive works and programming structures, and will provide students with advanced experience in Design Theory/Critical Thinking and Design Leadership.

#### Course Description
Building on the skills learned in Digital Literacy, this class advances students’ technical and conceptual skills in interaction design. Coursework emphasizes immersive and engaging user experience, site optimization, data visualization, networked databases, and design solutions through critical thinking and technical application.  Technically students will learn computer programming skills that may include advanced ActionScript, Processing, or others.  Students may also have the opportunity to explore physical interaction design and physical computing using Arduino.  Conceptually this class will explore ideas about human-machine interaction from mouse clicks to cyborg theory; interface design as it relates to the Internet, animation, game design and interactive media; form and interactivity in programming structures, and algorithmic systems.  

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of the semester, students will be expected to:

1. Develop web-based interactive projects, focusing on input and output functions as they relate to form, function and concept, through presentation of conceptual plans, creation of project prototypes, and submission of original project work.

2. Demonstrate an understanding of advanced scripting languages and techniques through oral/visual presentations of conceptual project proposals, the completion of technical exercises and the submission of original project work.

3. Demonstrate introductory physical computing skills, with a focus on interaction, interface design and mechanization, through the completion of technical exercises, presentation of conceptual plans, creation of project prototypes, and the submission of original project work.

4. Create dynamic strategies for organizing and presenting digital information through oral/visual presentations of conceptual project proposals, the completion of technical exercises and the submission of original project work.

5. Explain the significance of the key developments in the history of digital media, with a focus on how the precursors to interactivity lead to current contemporary practices, through participation in group discussions and writing of final project text.
